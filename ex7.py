# Task 4: Comment on the graph
"""
In the scatterplot, we visualize the performance of binary search for each task with different initial midpoints.
The color of each point represents the time taken for the corresponding search. It can be observed that certain
midpoints consistently lead to faster searches for specific tasks.

The choice of the initial midpoint does affect performance, as it determines the starting point of the search.
Choosing an initial midpoint closer to the target value can potentially reduce the number of iterations needed to
find the target. However, the optimal initial midpoint may vary for different search tasks, as seen in the scatterplot.

This emphasizes the importance of selecting an appropriate initial midpoint based on the characteristics of the
target values and array distribution to optimize binary search performance.
